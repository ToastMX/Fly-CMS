# Fly CMS - alpha


This is a completely Javascript based CMS for simple arti websites.

It is inpired by the Idea tha every Site is a planet and visiters just Flying around.

Just drop the folder to a PHP webspace, set password in security.php and add new "Planets".

By setting cool looking symbols and a cool looking Background image, you can realise all sorts of appearance.
